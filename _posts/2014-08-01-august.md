# Notes Dump

We now produce a dump containing all of the OSM Notes. It is updated daily and is available at [planet.openstreetmap.org/notes/](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/notes/)

# Pummelzacken

We've been experiencing problems with disks being kicked out of the RAID array on Pummelzacken (future nominatim server). We're working with our hardware supplier to find the root cause.

# Yevaud

Yevaud experienced a degraded disk array (when?). The increased load on the server led to delays in deploying new openstreetmap-carto stylesheets.
