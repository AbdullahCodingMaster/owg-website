# Hardware upgrades

## eustace

Eustace was migrated from a G4p to a G6 on 2nd March which should have save some more power at UCL.

## yevaud

New RAID controller and SSD were installed in yevaud on 2nd March but althought the card is recognised fine it does not currently seem to be seeing the disk so this needs further investigation.

## gorynych

The sponsors of the Russian tile cache, gorynych, have kindly upgraded it by adding an extra 16Gb of memory and two 240GB SSDs which are now in use (as a RAID1 mirror pair) as the tile store. This should hopefully improve performance for Russian users as the previous configuration was right on the limits of disk I/O bandwidth.
