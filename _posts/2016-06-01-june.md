# Upgrading machines to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

Work on upgrading machines to Ubuntu Xenial Xerus  [continues](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/81) with the web servers running the main site the most recent machines to be upgraded.

# Migration of web service to IC

As part of the work on upgrading the web servers the web service was migrated back from Bytemark to Imperial College and our slave database server, ramoth, was bought back into use without any further problems.
