# Failed hot-spare in DB machine

This appeared to have failed, and was racking up [a lot of "other" errors](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/49#issuecomment-143414304). It was [swapped out](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/49#issuecomment-144948083) and the new disk appears to be okay.

# New aerial imagery machine

Installed one of the new aerial imagery machines, [grisu](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Servers/grisu), at IC.
