## Budget

The OWG has submitted a [proposed 2023 budget](/2022/12/31/plan.html) to the board.

## Site visit

A site visit to Amsterdam was completed, cleaning up the rack, removing old hardware, and preparing for new servers.

## New general-purpose hardware

Four new general-purpose machines have been installed, two in Amsterdam, two in Dublin. This enables moving services from UCL and replacing old hardware.

## Website

Analytics cookie retention times for the website have been reduced in discussion with the LWG.
