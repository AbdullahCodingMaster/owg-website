# Server cooling issues (UCL)

We were notified on the 19th about an aircon failure at UCL, and had to shut down various machines to keep the temperature down:

* zark (service: jxapi.openstreetmap.org)
* draco (experimental: aerial imagery)
* ascalon (testing: ticket tracker)
* clifford (testing: forum)

# Other things

* Upgraded CPUs in orm
* Ordered new machine to act as second Nominatim server
* Ordered two HP DL360 G6 machines to go to OUOSL ($4568). The initial use is for North America tile caches but can be repurposed later.
