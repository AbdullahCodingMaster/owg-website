# irc.openstreetmap.org

The CGI:IRC page has been upgraded to redirect to the official OFTC webchat IRC. You can continue to use irc.openstreetmap.org, use https://webchat.oftc.net/, or use your choice of IRC client.

# tile.openstreetmap.org

A number of default user-agents and heavy use apps have had their access to tile.openstreetmap.org restricted. If you are developing software using the OSMF tile servers, be sure to follow the [tile usage policy](/policies/tiles/).
