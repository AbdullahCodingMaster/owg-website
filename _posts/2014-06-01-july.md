# Power outage

There was a power outage at our Imperial hosting on the 2nd July. After the power was restored (how many minutes?), several systems ran file system checks including the databases and on ironbelly. Ironbelly stores the GPX traces and acts as the gateway and DNS to our internal network, and so services were degraded until the file system checks were completed (how many minutes?)

# UCL Server Move

Server move is scheduled for Saturday 5th July
