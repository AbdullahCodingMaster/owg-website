# Replication Delays 2nd November

On 2nd November there were delays replicating the main database due to index rebuilding on the master server Katla. This lead to some confusion where mappers were successfully saving their changes, but not seeing the results when making subsequent map calls. The problem resolved itself a few hours later. The blocking of replication during certain stages of the index rebuilding was unexpected.

# Site outage 4th November

During a RAID rebuild after adding more disks to ironbelly, the machine became overloaded.Services that depend on ironbelly, notably the web frontends and rails backends for NFS mounts, were affected. Service was recovered by suspending non-critical tasks on ironbelly and slowing the rate of RAID rebuiding.
