# Network outage at IC

Around 19:00 on Saturday 13th December the web site began experiencing problems. TomH
became aware of this around 19:20 and after establishing there there appeared to be some
sort of network problem that made many machines at IC unreachable the site was manually
placed in offline mode as both the database and chef servers were unreachable.

An email was sent to IC just after midnight, as the problem was still unresolved, and
things came back to life around 01:30 and the site came back online automatically once
chef was available again.
