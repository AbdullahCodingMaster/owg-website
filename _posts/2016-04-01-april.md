# IC Electrical Testing

The primary site, where both the primary and replica databases are, informed us that they were going to perform electrical testing in one of the two rooms in May.

Initially, we thought we'd only have to [move a database to a different room](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/67). However, due to all of our networking being in a single room, it was not possible to keep anything at IC available over the weekend.

Given that [it's not 2011 any more](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2011/06/28/q3-2011-service-reductions/), we felt that this was not acceptable. Many thanks to [Bytemark hosting](https://twitter.com/bytemark/status/729698435339853824) who stepped into the breach and allowed us to [move some servers](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues?q=milestone%3A%22Server+Moves%22) there. With a primary database server hosted at Bytemark, and the replica in IC, we now have multi-site redundancy, although it is still a complicated matter to switch database primaries.

Thanks, also, to OSMF-US, who allowed us to use some of their AWS credits to fund a third replica in the cloud, just in case anything went horribly wrong with the move.

# New database server purchase

A new database server, [karm](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/karm.openstreetmap.org/) was purchased. This is OSM's first all-solid-state server, and should provide both faster API and website access and fewer maintenance issues. The new server is [being tested](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/78) while we make sure it's configured for best performance.

# Disks failed in Ramoth

[Two disks failed](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/60) in the replica database server. Spares were ordered, as the disks were old enough to not be under warranty, and replaced.
