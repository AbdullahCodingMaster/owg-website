# Tile logs

We started publishing logs from our tileservers, which may prove interest to reasearcher.

# German Tile Cache

The existing German tile cache, tabaluga, was replaced by two separate machines - katie (a slightly lower powered machine at Hetzner) and konqi (at EUserv).

# Outage 2nd February

Around 01:30 GMT on 2nd February the slave database server, ramoth, became unresponsive, leading to a partial outage of the web site and API that was resolved around 07:00 GMT when the server was power cycled.
