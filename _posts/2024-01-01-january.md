## 2024 Budget

The OWG has sent it's budget request for 2024 in to the board. We are requesting an operational budget of €130,767.56 and a capital budget of €12,650.00.

We are opting to extend the life of some hardware rather than purchase new, which saves significantly on the capital costs. Capital costs *will* be higher in the following years based on the lifecycle of our current hardware and the possibility of new requirements. Several operational items are budgeted at the high end of the possible cost such as travel to data centers and we will, like always, try to minimize these costs. 

This budget is approximately 50% lower in cash flow than the 2022 and 2023 budgets. We believe the operational expenses are lower, but cannot be positive as this budget is prepared with operational and capital expenses instead of previous budgets which were purely cash flow.

The spreadsheet used to derive these budget numbers is [available on the website](/2024/01/25/owg_budget.ods)
