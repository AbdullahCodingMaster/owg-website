# Replace failed RAID battery in Noquiklos

Noquiklos, the GPS tile server, had a failed RAID array battery which was degrading performance. This was replaced with a flash-backed write cache. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/100).

# Upgrade Clifford from G5 to G6

Clifford, the soon-to-be forum server, used to use "Generation 5" HP [hardware](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/clifford.openstreetmap.org/). The "Generation 6" hardware is both lower-power and more reliable, so the forum should be much improved, along with the power usage at UCL. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/109).

# Replace failed fans & disk in Yevaud

Internal fans had failed in [yevaud], one of the tile rendering servers. Although the warranty expired long, long ago, the supplier (now known as [Zeta Systems](http://www.zeta.systems/)) provided us with replacement parts free of charge, which was very nice of them. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/108).

The failing disk was finally replaced in yevaud, after much drama. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/57).

# Replace RAM in Ridley

One stick of RAM in ridley, the web server for [OSM Foundation](https://www.osmfoundation.org/)-related sites, had a reported ECC failure, which is often indicative of impending failure. As we had suitable RAM rescued from other systems, it seemed like a good opportunity to replace it all and double the memory available in that machine. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/107).

# Base backup on karm

A base backup of the main database was taken on karm, which should allow it to start being used as a replica database server. This will mean we're not reliant on ramoth any more, which is great as it has [has](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/91) [not](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/69) [always](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/60) [been](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/39) [reliable](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/24) and is particularly un-graceful when [coming back from a cold boot](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/92). [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/94).

# CGImap 0.5.5 deployed

This version of [CGImap](https://github.com/zerebubuth/openstreetmap-cgimap) allows editors to avoid problems with per-IP address rate limiting by using OAuth to sign all API requests. This makes CGImap perform rate-limiting on a per-user rather than per-IP address basis. [Issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/operations/issues/36), [mailing list announcement](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2016-October/029544.html).

# Better logging for export failures

Report errors on resource exhaustion. [Commit](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef/commit/fd31d0bd32886ca4075d4938e374c5c7d72c9b8c).

# Planet web server instability

The planet web server has been having a [series of short outages](http://stats.pingdom.com/p310g2klasry/757116/2016/10). These are possibly related to [known issues in the "event" worker](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=53555) and hopefully have been [fixed by moving to the "worker" worker](https://github.com/openstreetmap/chef/commit/84f1906f0133a25bff7fadbadbb03ff76e6da504).

# Carto stylesheet v2.44.1 deployed

The latest version of the carto stylesheet [was released](https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/dev/2016-October/029545.html).

A [new mod_tile package](https://github.com/openstreetmap/mod_tile/pull/142) was deployed to help take advantage of [Google's "Noto" fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) and improve multi-lingual text rendering.

# New tile cache in Spain

A new tile cache, called [culebre](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/servers/culebre.openstreetmap.org/), was generously donated by the [University of Zaragoza](http://osluz.unizar.es/).

# Replication outage 2016-10-14

The [main storage disk on ironbelly](http://munin.osm.org/openstreetmap/ironbelly.openstreetmap/df.html), the planet file server, filled up. This caused replication to fail. To mitigate, larger disks are being ordered. Old file clean-ups will also be reviewed to see if unnecessary files can be removed regularly. Monitoring is in place to warn when disks are approaching capacity.
