# Database server outage

Around 0130 BST on Good Friday the master database server, ramoth, became unresponsive and as a consequence the web site quickly began to fail

TomH power cycled the server using the remote console at around 0635 BST and the database and web site were up and running by 0645 BST resulting in a total outage of just over five hours.

The replication diffs didn't restart properly and fixed by Jon Burgess later the same day.
