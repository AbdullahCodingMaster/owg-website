OWG has adopted the following policy for giving credit to supporters who donate hardware or hosting to OSMF. OWG will:

1. Credit everyone on [https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks](https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks) and link to that page from [http://osm.org/about](http://osm.org/about) and the [front page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) welcome message.
2. On the [front page](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) welcome message and the [about](http://osm.org/about) page credit
    - the top 1-4 donors as determined by the OWG, sorted by estimated replacement value of what they sponsor (currently Fastly);
    - corporate members, linked to the OSMF corporate membership page; and
    - other partners
3. Link corporate members to the OSMF Wiki corporate member page and link partners to https://hardware.openstreetmap.org/thanks
4. Try to publicise new supporters who are donating hardware or hosting from time to time via blog posts, tweets and other publicity channels.
