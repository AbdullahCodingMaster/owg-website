# {{ page.title }}

* Anyone who meets the following criteria is eligible to become an OSMF Sysadmin:
  * They run a service or services externally that OSMF wants to run in-house, or
  * They have contributed a significant patch to our Chef repo
* The Operations Working Group will ask the candidate if they would like to join.
* Candidate Sysadmins must agree not to disclose any confidential information, including logs and personally identifying information, that they have access to, and not to intercept any private communications.
* The candidate is then given access to a service or machine to look after, allocated by the Sysadmins group.
* After 3 months, they are given access to all the systems, only if:
  * they are still engaged, and
  * they are looking to take on more responsibility, and
  * the existing Sysadmins agree, in majority.
* A Sysadmin will lose access to the servers if, for a period of 6 months:
  * They haven't contributed to running a service (by intervention, upgrading, etc), and
  * They haven't contributed any patches to the Chef repo
